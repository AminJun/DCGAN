### Pretrained CIFAR10 DCGAN
These models and code is taken from (this repository)[https://github.com/csinva/gan-vae-pretrained-pytorch/], so to them I give the full credit. 
However, using this in your project you can simply import the Generator and Discriminator without needing to wory about loading the weights and initializing the network anyway.
